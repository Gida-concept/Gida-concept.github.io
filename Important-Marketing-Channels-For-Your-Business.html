        <b>Marketing Channels To Consider For Your Small Business </b>
     </h2>
     
         <p>
            Here is  a list of  7 marketing
            channels that get the most result for any kind of  business. Our selections are based on current trends, proven results and recent marketing statistics.

<p>3. Search engine optimization</p>
<p>4. Online advertising</p>
<p>5. Video marketing</p>
<p>6. Email marketing</p>
<p>7. Traditional advertising</p>

<br>


<h2>
  1.  <b>Social Media  </b>
 </h2>
            <p>
                Do you knoow there are over 4.66 billion internet users in the world today and 4.14 billion social media users worldwide. 
            </p>
            <p>Thanks to social media, we now have a more connected marketplace available to entrepreneurs.   Are you confused about which social media platform to focus on?</p>
            <center><div  class="more-services">
                <p><a href="https://wa.link/8df13w">Send a Message
                    <br>  Now!</a></p>
                </div>
                </center>

                <p>In a survey by Databox, 62.4% of people said they are more likely to interact with a brand on Instagram rather than on other social media channels. But with 85% of respondents following at least six brands, there is a high level of competition. If you are a small business owner or a startup with a limited budget, it will pay off 
                    to focus on the channels where your clients are not only present but also open to interacting with your brand.</p>
        

            <br>



<h2>
  2.  <b>Website  </b>
 </h2>
            <p>
                A business website can be used as a tool to grow your image and communicate your business’ message. You can also use a website as an online store where customers can make purchases. 
            </p>
            <p>A website adds credibility to a brand. For service or product-based businesses, a website serves as an 
                online office for potential clients who want to learn more about your business before they buy from you. </p>

            <p>An entrepreneur with a service-based business needs an informational website where they add their testimonials, show people what their business is about, services they offer and build trust with their customers. Besides helping you to sell faster,
                 a professional website also builds the perception people have of your business.</p>

<p>For a product-based business, you need an e-commerce website. An eCommerce website that serves as an 
    online store is non-negotiable in today’s digital world. However, due to the features needed to create an effective and sales-driven eCommerce 
    website, it can be quite expensive. 
    A good eCommerce website can cost you over ₦90,000 - 200,000 to build and will require more funds to maintain the site. </p>

                          </p>

  <p>
    96% of consumers increased their online video consumption in 2020, and 90% said they wanted to see more videos from businesses and brands. Across social media today, videos have a wider reach than photos. TikTok, Instagram and Snapchat all encourage users to share 
    more videos on their platforms. Because it’s visual driven, viewers can understand your message easily and move to action faster.

     establish a sense of trust with their existing clients, as well as to reach out to potential new clients.</p>

<h2>
    6.  <b>Email Marketing</b>
    </h2>
  <p>
    As more buyers place value on relationship-driven brands, email marketing is a medium to connect with your customers.
</p>
                
 <p>Email marketing helps to personalize the experience of doing business with a brand/company. Unlike ads that are often considered intrusive,
      a customer gives you permission to send them emails. 
      Since it’s consent-driven, buyers are more likely to open your emails and pay attention to what you are selling. For data-driven companies, it’s another 
      medium to get reliable information on what your customers respond to and how best to serve them. </p>
                                
<br>                            


<h2>
    7.  <b>Traditional Advertising </b>
    </h2>
  <p>
    Due to the increased popularity of digital marketing, it’s easy to overlook traditional advertising. While it may not be applicable to all businesses, 
    traditional forms of advertising like Radio jingles, billboards and flyers still get results for businesses. 
</p>
<br>
