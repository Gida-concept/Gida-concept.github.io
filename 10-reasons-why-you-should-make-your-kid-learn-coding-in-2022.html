<h1> 10 Reasons Why You Should Make Your Kid Learn Coding in 2022</h1>
<br>

<h3>
    Starting to learn how to code at a young age can never go wrong. Watch out for 10 reasons for kids to learn coding.
</h3>

    <p>
        The fast-evolving technology has made it easier for us to lead our lives. We have become dependent on technology to the extent that today, it is practically impossible to live without it. All this throws light on why learning how to code is no less than a life skill these days. With that being said, starting to learn how to code at a young age can never go wrong. On that note, watch out for 10 reasons for kids to learn coding.
        </p>

     
            
        <br>
        

    <h2> Builds Problem Solving Skills </h2>
    <p>Computational thinking teaches students to break down large problems into small, achievable steps. Building this skill alone is priceless, and many of our students claim that they now use this approach in general problem-solving. As students learn how to write code, they will make mistakes which in turn produce bugs and other unintended outcomes. Fortunately, computer programming is one of the few fields in which you can test solutions immediately.</p>

        <br>
        

            <h2>
                Math & Logical Problem Solving
            </h2>
            <p>
                From a math perspective, coding is known to help kids visualize more abstract concepts in a fun format that lets them apply mathematics to real-life problem-solving. Computer science and coding aren’t just about developing a program to solve or perform tasks. It’s also about logical problem solving, using the core basics of mathematics.
            </p>

            <br>

        <h2>Do It Yourself</h2>
        <p>Web-based applications are not the only consumers of code. Internet of Things(IoT) devices, drones, and chips require programming. Also, hardware devices require programming. By programming the right hardware, one can make robots and remote control cars at home. Today, there are many hardware kits with instructions available in the market, for kids and adults, to do these projects. Even a home automation system can be DIY (Do It Yourself). Without learning to code, programming can become complex. Hence coding gives access to building new things.</p>

            <br>


<h2>Builds Resilience and Instills Persistence</h2>
<p>Kids who code learn to fail gracefully and learn from their mistakes. They also learn that success is often the result of hard work and many repetitions of trial and error rather than immediate mastery of a skill. Coding requires young people to retrace their steps, assess the issues at hand, and create a detailed action plan for recovery. These are advanced life skills that can be learned through the coding creation process. 
</p>

<br>

<h2>Improves Academic Performance
</h2>
<p>Coding has benefits in academic areas as well. Coding teaches students how to plan and organize their thoughts, which leads to better writing skills. Coding also helps students learn how to structure large tasks and break them up into smaller steps, create theories, and develop logic patterns, which will benefit them in any academic subject and their adult life.</p>

<br>

<h2>Develops Logical Thinking
</h2>
<p>Coding encourages you to use logic and algorithms to create a program. When facing a new challenge, you need to follow a logical approach to solve the issue. Therefore, this is an exercise for your brain to train up your logical ability. Logical thinking is not only about solving algorithms but is also beneficial to your personal and professional life.</p>


<br>

<h2>Teaches Attention to Detail
</h2>
<p>Coding projects are complex, requiring lots of individual steps. To be successful kids who code must adopt a detail-minded approach. Attention to detail, especially in the design phase where the essence of what’s required is defined. With attention to detail not only is it possible to make something work, but it can also lead to creating a thing of beauty.</p>



<br>

<h2>High-Paying Jobs

</h2>
<p>More and more aspects of our everyday life are becoming automated. As this happens, the supply gap for people with coding skills continues to grow. It’s estimated that as many as 1 million jobs will go unfilled over the next decade because workers won’t have the necessary coding skills.</p>



<br>

<h2>Fosters Creativity 

</h2>
<p>By experimenting, children learn and strengthen their brains. Even when they make a mistake, they learn. Children can be creative, and creativity is encouraged. Creativity is part of the process and not always the product. Learning Resources has many imaginative play toys to help spark more creativity with your child.</p>




<br>

<h2>Builds Communication Skills
</h2>
<p>Communication skills are essential for one to succeed in almost every aspect of life. Whether it is personal or professional life, the ability to communicate clearly and effectively goes a long way. By learning to code, kids develop effective communication skills as much of coding requires one to be an efficient team member. To work well in a team, kids need to be able to develop their communication skills and relay their messages most effectively. Whether the discussion is being held verbally or in a written form, a powerful communication skill can be one of the most important assets in your kid’s arsenal.</p>
